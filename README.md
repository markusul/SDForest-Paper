# Spectrally Deconfounded Random Forests

This repository contains all the code used for the paper "Spectrally Deconfounded Random Forests" by Markus Ulmer, Cyrill Scheidegger, and Peter BÃ¼hlmann (2025).

All the provided R-code uses the R-package [*SDModels*](https://markusul.github.io/SDModels/) v0.1, providing functionality to estimate SDForests and analyze the estimated functions.

-   `simulation_study` contains all the code to produce and visualize the simulations

-   `cBench` contains all the code to produce and visualize the single-cell gene expression experiments

-   the cBench data can be found here: <https://github.com/causalbench/causalbench>
